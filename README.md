<i>New WiFi Pineapple Pager</i>
</p>

The first Payload-powered WiFi Pineapple is here — and it runs DuckyScript™, Hak5's simple and powerful scripting language. Paired with Bash and backed by Linux, it brings serious scripting capabilities to your operations. Launch targeted attacks or set alert payloads to fire off based on live WiFi activity. Ringtones, vibes and visuals.

Take control of the airspace with the 8th generation PineAP engine — now over 100× faster. Rebuilt from the kernel up, this attack suite is hyper optimized for advanced WiFi operations.

Run Rogue AP, Man-in-the-Middle, and Deauth attacks. Nab handshakes, OSINT and more, all from a live dashboard.

# Payload Library Overview

The `library/` directory contains organized payload collections:

- **`library/wifi-bomb-payload/`** - WiFi beacon bombing and AP simulation payloads. Contains the Wi-Fi Beacon Bomb payload that creates 1000+ fake access points for network testing and reconnaissance.
- **`library/user/`** - User-contributed payloads including Evil Portal implementations and custom network attacks
- **`library/alerts/`** - Alert-based payloads triggered by WiFi events (handshake captures, device detections, etc.)

Each payload directory should include:
- `payload.sh` or `payload.txt` - The main payload script
- `README.md` - Documentation with usage instructions
- Supporting files (scripts, templates, data files as needed)

# About DuckyScript™

DuckyScript is the payload language of Hak5 gear.

Originating on the Hak5 USB Rubber Ducky as a standalone language, the WiFi Pineapple Pager uses DuckyScript commands to bring the ethos of easy-to-use actions to the payload language.

DuckyScript commands are always in all capital letters to distinguish them from other system or script language commands. Typically, they take a small number of options (or sometimes no options).

Payloads can be constructed of DuckyScript commands alone, or combined with the power of bash scripting and system commands to create fully custom, advanced actions.

The files in this repository are _the source code_ for your payloads and run _directly on the device_ **no compilation required** - simply place your `payload.sh` in the appropriate directory and the Pager will recognize and execute it.

# Please adhere to the following best practices and style guides when submitting a payload.

Once you have developed your payload, you are encouraged to contribute to this repository by submitting a Pull Request. Reviewed and Approved pull requests will add your payload to this repository.

Please include all resources required for the payload to run. If needed, provide a README.md in the root of your payload's directory to explain things such as intended use, required configuration, and any dependencies.


### Purely Destructive payloads will not be accepted. No, it's not "just a prank".
Subject to change. Please ensure any submissions meet the [latest version](https://github.com/hak5/wifipineapple-pager/blob/master/README.md) of these standards before submitting a Pull Request.


## Naming Conventions

Please give your payload a unique, descriptive and appropriate name. Do not use spaces in payload, directory or file names. Each payload should be submitted into its own directory, with `-` or `_` used as delimiters.

The payload itself should be named `payload.sh` (for bash payloads) or `payload.txt` (for DuckyScript payloads).

## Payload Configuration

In many cases, payloads will require some level of configuration by the end payload user. Be sure to take the following into careful consideration to ensure your payload is easily tested, used and maintained.

- Remember to use PLACEHOLDERS for configurable portions of your payload - do not share your personal URLs, API keys, Passphrases, etc...
- Do not leave defaults that point at live services
- Make note of both required and optional configuration(s) in your payload using comments at the top of your payload or "inline" where applicable

## Payload Format

Payloads should begin with comments specifying at the very least the name of the payload and author. Additional information such as a brief description, the target, any dependencies / prerequisites should also be included at the top of the file.

Example format for DuckyScript payloads:

```
# Title: Example payload
# Description: Example payload with configuration options
# Author: Hak5
# Version: 1.0
# Category: Remote-Access
# Net Mode: NAT
#
# LED State Descriptions
# Magenta Solid - Configuring NETMODE
# LED OFF - Waiting for BUTTON
# Red Blink 2 Times - Connection Failed
# Amber Blink 5 Times - Connection Successful
# Red Blink 1 Time - Command Failed
# Cyan Blink 1 Time - Command Successful
```

### Configuration Options

Configurable options should be specified in variables at the top of the payload file:

```
# Options
SSH_USER="username"
SSH_HOST="hostname"
PORT=31337
```

## Bash Payloads

Bash payloads are powerful scripts that can leverage the full Linux environment of the Pager. They should follow standard bash scripting practices:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Title: Example Bash Payload
# Description: Demonstrates bash payload structure
# Author: Your Name
# Version: 1.0

# Configuration
TARGET_HOST="${1:-example.com}"
TIMEOUT=30

# Functions
log_message() {
    echo "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] $1"
}

# Main
log_message "Starting payload execution..."
# Your payload logic here
log_message "Payload complete"
```

## Staged Payloads

"Staged payloads" are payloads that **download** code from some resource external to the payload file.

While staging code used in payloads is often useful and appropriate, using this (or another) github repository as the means of deploying those stages is not. This repository is **not a CDN for deployed payloads**.

Staged code should be copied to and hosted on an appropriate server for doing so **by the end user** - Github and this repository are simply resources for sharing code among developers and users.

See: [GitHub acceptable use policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies#5-site-access-and-safety)

Additionally, any source code that is intended to be staged **(by the end user on the appropriate infrastructure)** should be included in any payload submissions either in the comments of the payload file or as separate files in the payload directory.

### Including URLs

URLs used for retrieving staged code should refer exclusively to **example.com** using DEFINE in any payload submissions.

### Staged Example

**Example scenario: your payload downloads a script and then executes it on a target machine.**
- Include the script in the directory with your payload
- Provide instructions for the user to move the script to the appropriate hosting service.
- Provide a DEFINE with the placeholder example.com for the user to easily configure once they have hosted the script
